2
00:01:42,893 --> 00:01:45,693
It's done, Mr. Donovan.
The money is secure.

3
00:01:45,695 --> 00:01:46,763
Good.

4
00:01:47,531 --> 00:01:48,633
Good.

5
00:01:49,066 --> 00:01:50,501
Then, we can go home.

6
00:02:14,057 --> 00:02:16,691
- The plane is ready?
- You'll be in Dubai for dinner.

7
00:02:16,693 --> 00:02:19,661
Excellent.
And the Special Operations team?

8
00:02:19,663 --> 00:02:21,299
Contract cancelled, sir.

9
00:02:22,098 --> 00:02:23,300
Awesome.

10
00:02:40,616 --> 00:02:43,554
C'mon, c'mon!

11
00:03:24,995 --> 00:03:28,733
Ahmed, move! Go, go, go!

12
00:04:21,584 --> 00:04:22,919
Hello, boss.

13
00:04:36,966 --> 00:04:38,603
You should all be fucking dead!

14
00:04:38,968 --> 00:04:40,935
Important safety tip, Ronnie,

15
00:04:40,937 --> 00:04:42,973
never trust the locals
to get the job done.

16
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,675
You should've just paid us,
you fucking dipshit.

17
00:04:45,843 --> 00:04:46,942
All of this for the money?

18
00:04:46,944 --> 00:04:49,947
Oh, we've done worse for you
over the last two years.

19
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,682
By my calculation, you owe,

20
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:55,617
- what with time and expenses...
- Aggravation.

21
00:04:55,619 --> 00:04:57,622
...let's just call it
a straight-up million.

22
00:04:58,021 --> 00:04:59,557
Fuck you!

23
00:05:03,694 --> 00:05:05,596
We're not here to play games.

24
00:05:06,028 --> 00:05:08,497
- Where's our money?
- I... I had to get it out

25
00:05:08,499 --> 00:05:10,098
of the country!
Feds were getting too close!

26
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,102
You can't touch it!

27
00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:13,601
- I'm gonna fucking kill you.
- No!

28
00:05:13,603 --> 00:05:15,135
It's in the banks,
scattered everywhere,

29
00:05:15,137 --> 00:05:16,907
thousand,
small automatic deposits!

30
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,039
U.S. bank?

31
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,845
- U.S., Russia, Switzerland.
- Name one.

32
00:05:22,045 --> 00:05:24,048
A U.S. bank, name one!

33
00:05:24,247 --> 00:05:27,851
Unity Savings and Loan,
Chesterford, Massachusetts!

34
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,887
Over a million,
I can help you get it!

35
00:05:30,153 --> 00:05:32,988
You need me. Just get me some
fucking medical attention,

36
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,125
and we can make a deal.

37
00:05:34,524 --> 00:05:35,992
Or we could just do it our way?

38
00:05:37,593 --> 00:05:39,129
- Your way?
- The hard way.

39
00:05:39,596 --> 00:05:40,730
No!

40
00:06:52,069 --> 00:06:53,668
You!
You're under arrest!

41
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:57,072
- Hey!
- Let's go! Let's go! Come on!

42
00:06:57,074 --> 00:06:59,810
Don't touch me!
I didn't do anything!

43
00:07:12,822 --> 00:07:13,957
We're clear.

44
00:07:14,757 --> 00:07:16,993
Idiot! Incompetent!

45
00:07:17,961 --> 00:07:19,961
I was six steps away
from arresting

46
00:07:19,963 --> 00:07:22,133
the biggest antiquity smuggler
in Asia!

47
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,235
Sorry, ma'am.
Orders.

48
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,939
Carter,

49
00:07:29,372 --> 00:07:31,906
if this is another
stupid security drill,

50
00:07:31,908 --> 00:07:33,277
I swear I'll kill you.

51
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,115
Yes, sir.

52
00:07:39,649 --> 00:07:40,917
<i>Capisco.</i>

53
00:07:43,387 --> 00:07:44,721
<i>Si.</i>

54
00:07:47,858 --> 00:07:48,992
This time...

55
00:07:49,793 --> 00:07:50,927
I'll find them.

56
00:08:01,937 --> 00:08:05,276
- Major Rahimi.
- Ah, the eternal Colonel Moss.

57
00:08:06,742 --> 00:08:08,778
What the hell happened here?

58
00:08:09,745 --> 00:08:12,312
That's exactly
what we are trying to assess.

59
00:08:12,314 --> 00:08:15,019
We?

60
00:08:35,905 --> 00:08:37,107
Thank you.

61
00:08:40,043 --> 00:08:43,377
Our database confirms her
as Natalia Buskhova.

62
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:45,379
- Hmm.
- Wanted for money laundering,

63
00:08:45,381 --> 00:08:47,317
drug smuggling
and arms dealing.

64
00:08:47,484 --> 00:08:50,787
- And who the hell are you?
- Rossi, Interpol.

65
00:08:54,857 --> 00:08:57,260
- Donovan.
- You know this man?

66
00:08:58,195 --> 00:09:00,931
CEO of a large
construction company.

67
00:09:01,331 --> 00:09:03,064
He'd set up local companies

68
00:09:03,066 --> 00:09:05,369
to bid on American
reconstruction contracts.

69
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,672
- War profiteer.
- Mm-hmm.

70
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,206
How much did he steal?

71
00:09:09,472 --> 00:09:12,976
Close to a hundred million
over the last two years.

72
00:09:15,211 --> 00:09:17,081
The killers targeted the front

73
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,414
and rear car to track
their prey.

74
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:20,515
They used predominantly

75
00:09:20,517 --> 00:09:22,119
5.56-cal.

76
00:09:22,952 --> 00:09:25,152
But there is evidence
of a large 50-cal

77
00:09:25,154 --> 00:09:28,858
sniper rifle used,
most likely American made.

78
00:09:30,393 --> 00:09:32,363
I suspect Donovan's own team.

79
00:09:33,964 --> 00:09:37,268
All ex-special forces.
They are the ones I'm chasing.

80
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:40,403
Why?
What's Interpol's take in this?

81
00:09:40,836 --> 00:09:42,706
The failed Kabul extraction.

82
00:09:42,905 --> 00:09:45,973
Those men killed
the whole military team,

83
00:09:45,975 --> 00:09:48,979
- including one of our agents.
- So you're getting close.

84
00:09:49,513 --> 00:09:52,283
Donovan's running out on them,
the mercs panic.

85
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:57,021
These men do not panic.
They adapt and execute.

86
00:09:57,988 --> 00:10:00,391
They will kill anyone
who gets in their way.

87
00:10:00,557 --> 00:10:01,859
Hmm.

88
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,319
<i>What the fuck, man?</i>

89
00:11:02,918 --> 00:11:05,088
What did I even do
to deserve this shit?

90
00:11:05,922 --> 00:11:07,324
I don't bother anybody.

91
00:11:07,591 --> 00:11:09,924
Are you serious?

92
00:11:09,926 --> 00:11:11,328
Yeah.

93
00:11:11,961 --> 00:11:13,862
- Look at this little bitch!
- Holy shit.

94
00:11:13,864 --> 00:11:16,363
What the fuck are you doing
in here, faggot?

95
00:11:16,365 --> 00:11:17,931
You know
this is the senior bathroom.

96
00:11:17,933 --> 00:11:19,499
No, it's not, man.
I can be here if I want to.

97
00:11:19,501 --> 00:11:21,536
- What did you say?
- Ah, man, get off me!

98
00:11:21,538 --> 00:11:23,070
I'm just using the bathroom!

99
00:11:23,072 --> 00:11:24,039
- Get off!
- Punch me!

100
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,973
I'm not gonna fight you!
Get the fuck off me!

101
00:11:25,975 --> 00:11:27,608
I know you're not.
You're not gonna do shit,

102
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,344
- 'cause you're a fucking pussy.
- Stop!

103
00:11:29,346 --> 00:11:30,978
That's why you don't have
any friends here.

104
00:11:32,349 --> 00:11:35,983
- Stop it! I hate you!
- Aw, don't cry.

105
00:11:35,985 --> 00:11:38,389
Help! Somebody help me!

106
00:11:39,154 --> 00:11:40,055
<i>Help! Ow,</i>

107
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,257
- you're hurting me!
- Ow, he's hurting me.

108
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:44,128
Stop! Stop!

109
00:11:44,394 --> 00:11:45,962
<i>Somebody help me!</i>

110
00:11:46,296 --> 00:11:47,364
Get off me!

111
00:11:48,365 --> 00:11:50,366
- Oh, dude!
- What's going on in here?

112
00:11:53,636 --> 00:11:55,371
Kenny, stop. Get back here!

113
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,522
Have you seen my vest?

114
00:12:15,926 --> 00:12:18,596
Babe? Lisa? Babe?

115
00:12:21,664 --> 00:12:23,132
Where are you?

116
00:12:26,669 --> 00:12:30,139
- Hey, Lisa, didn't you hear me?
- Baby, don't freak out, okay?

117
00:12:31,474 --> 00:12:32,940
Don't tell me
to don't freak out.

118
00:12:32,942 --> 00:12:34,043
Don't freak out about what?

119
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:36,413
I'm pregnant.

120
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,883
No way.

121
00:12:39,282 --> 00:12:40,350
Yeah.

122
00:12:41,183 --> 00:12:43,187
I mean, I... I think so.

123
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,286
I'll have your mom take me
to the doctor's today

124
00:12:46,288 --> 00:12:47,423
to make sure, but...

125
00:12:48,424 --> 00:12:50,458
- Oh, my God. Really?
- Yeah.

126
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,930
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

127
00:12:53,495 --> 00:12:56,100
- Oh, my God. I love you.
- I love you, too.

128
00:13:00,235 --> 00:13:03,039
Eleanor, have you seen my, uh...

129
00:13:07,376 --> 00:13:09,612
You are a treasure.

130
00:13:10,046 --> 00:13:12,682
And we should be enjoying
our day together.

131
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,583
When the man calls, you go.

132
00:13:15,585 --> 00:13:18,589
You could have said no.
It's our anniversary, Randy.

133
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,589
How is my hair?

134
00:13:22,591 --> 00:13:25,328
You should leave the bank
and become a stand-up comedian.

135
00:13:25,528 --> 00:13:28,065
Then I could not spend
my nights with you.

136
00:13:28,331 --> 00:13:30,301
You don't spend your days
with me, either.

137
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,101
Eleanor.

138
00:13:33,302 --> 00:13:35,369
It wouldn't kill you if you
were more assertive, Randy.

139
00:13:35,371 --> 00:13:38,605
- You do so much for that bank.
- Okay, I'll ask... No, no.

140
00:13:38,607 --> 00:13:40,677
I'll instruct Judy
to close up tonight.

141
00:13:41,211 --> 00:13:43,143
You and I can have
an early dinner.

142
00:13:43,145 --> 00:13:46,382
And then, together,
maybe, we can...

143
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,688
fall asleep in front of the TV?

144
00:13:52,221 --> 00:13:54,357
I would like that very much.

145
00:13:56,658 --> 00:13:59,495
- Go, if you're going.
- I love you too.

146
00:14:08,571 --> 00:14:11,041
- Good morning.
- Well,

147
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,142
good morning.

148
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:16,713
Always nice to start my day
helping a pretty lady.

149
00:14:18,248 --> 00:14:20,584
You here to buy? Shoot?

150
00:14:22,652 --> 00:14:24,321
I give lessons.

151
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,191
I'll be buying,
if you have what I need.

152
00:14:27,423 --> 00:14:29,994
Hmm. Well, I got a...

153
00:14:30,293 --> 00:14:32,395
...great selection
of ladies' weapons.

154
00:14:35,398 --> 00:14:39,036
They're very pretty.
But how do I know they work?

155
00:14:39,668 --> 00:14:42,372
Lady, I'm a combat vet.

156
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:47,478
And every weapon in here
meets my exacting standards.

157
00:14:47,811 --> 00:14:50,080
What if I wanted something...

158
00:14:51,346 --> 00:14:54,183
- bigger?
- What do you have in mind?

159
00:14:55,317 --> 00:14:57,020
AR 15's...

160
00:14:57,687 --> 00:14:59,423
Benelli M4's...

161
00:15:00,222 --> 00:15:02,625
maybe, a 107 Barrett...

162
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,062
grenades...

163
00:15:05,495 --> 00:15:08,065
a little C-4,
for old times' sake.

164
00:15:09,164 --> 00:15:10,800
Hey, I don't know
what you're talking about.

165
00:15:11,301 --> 00:15:13,237
Oh, Carl...

166
00:15:14,504 --> 00:15:16,240
you're too modest.

167
00:15:17,573 --> 00:15:20,109
Tre said you could fix me up.

168
00:15:20,777 --> 00:15:22,312
I don't know no Tre.

169
00:15:24,246 --> 00:15:26,750
- Are you certain?
- Yup.

170
00:15:39,394 --> 00:15:40,596
Mr. Fisk...

171
00:15:41,597 --> 00:15:43,464
If one person dies

172
00:15:43,466 --> 00:15:45,436
because of a weapon
you've provided...

173
00:15:46,402 --> 00:15:48,806
I'll make sure
you are held liable.

174
00:16:17,299 --> 00:16:18,701
Hey, what about the name George?

175
00:16:19,168 --> 00:16:21,502
- I like the name George.
- I don't think so.

176
00:16:21,504 --> 00:16:23,706
- Why not? George is a good name.
- You're so cute.

177
00:16:24,506 --> 00:16:26,542
We don't even know
if it's a boy or a girl yet.

178
00:16:26,808 --> 00:16:29,245
It's gonna be a boy,
I promise you that.

179
00:16:31,246 --> 00:16:32,582
What about Mike?

180
00:16:35,184 --> 00:16:37,551
Are you kidding?

181
00:16:37,553 --> 00:16:40,490
Thank you for coming down
here so quickly, Mrs. Ralston.

182
00:16:41,256 --> 00:16:43,291
You threatened to expel my son.

183
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,528
Well, as you and Kenny
are aware,

184
00:16:45,727 --> 00:16:47,728
we have a zero-tolerance policy

185
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,167
when it comes to violence
in this school.

186
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,333
Do you have
a zero-tolerance policy

187
00:16:52,335 --> 00:16:55,405
when it comes to my son getting
his head shoved in the urinal?

188
00:16:55,705 --> 00:16:57,738
The teacher who reported
your son's attack

189
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,442
saw no evidence of that.

190
00:17:00,275 --> 00:17:03,578
Look, we expect our students
to report harassment.

191
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,884
We even have
a student protocol that says,

192
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:11,188
"If a teen's being mean,
to a teacher, come clean."

193
00:17:12,321 --> 00:17:14,690
I'm gonna be late for my shift
at the hospital.

194
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:17,427
Are you planning
to expel my son?

195
00:17:17,826 --> 00:17:19,826
I'd like to try and avoid that.

196
00:17:19,828 --> 00:17:22,231
Kenny's never been
in trouble before.

197
00:17:23,232 --> 00:17:25,900
Look, we have a community
outreach program,

198
00:17:25,902 --> 00:17:28,436
run in cooperation
with the local police force.

199
00:17:28,438 --> 00:17:29,571
Police?

200
00:17:29,573 --> 00:17:31,742
My son's not doing one of those
Scared Straight things.

201
00:17:32,575 --> 00:17:35,711
Try and think of this more
as a course correction.

202
00:17:36,578 --> 00:17:37,844
It's a ride-along.

203
00:17:37,846 --> 00:17:40,483
He accompanies an officer
on a routine patrol.

204
00:17:40,983 --> 00:17:43,352
And then, he gets
a close-up look of

205
00:17:43,586 --> 00:17:45,486
where bad choices can take you.

206
00:17:45,488 --> 00:17:47,354
An African-American boy

207
00:17:47,356 --> 00:17:49,393
sits in the back
of a police car all day.

208
00:17:49,592 --> 00:17:51,495
And that's your solution?

209
00:17:52,327 --> 00:17:54,530
Well, it's that or expulsion.

210
00:17:57,933 --> 00:18:00,336
What's wrong with naming
the baby after your dad?

211
00:18:01,671 --> 00:18:03,340
He doesn't deserve it.

212
00:18:05,807 --> 00:18:07,877
<i>My dad doesn't care
about that kind of stuff.</i>

213
00:18:08,744 --> 00:18:10,246
<i>Your dad loves you.</i>

214
00:18:10,646 --> 00:18:12,680
<i>He just doesn't know
how to express it.</i>

215
00:18:12,682 --> 00:18:15,485
- <i>He's had a tough year.</i>
- <i>Well, I don't care.</i>

216
00:18:15,751 --> 00:18:17,921
<i>He needs to learn
it's not all about him.</i>

217
00:18:19,521 --> 00:18:20,790
<i>He's still coming to terms.</i>

218
00:18:21,758 --> 00:18:23,360
<i>It happened so fast.</i>

219
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,495
<i>Seven months?</i>

220
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,697
<i>In a 30-year marriage.
I know to us,</i>

221
00:18:29,699 --> 00:18:31,701
- <i>seven months felt like...</i>
- <i>Like a lifetime?</i>

222
00:18:32,067 --> 00:18:34,937
Yeah, it was. Hers!

223
00:18:35,971 --> 00:18:38,674
He couldn't accept
the diagnosis, Lisa.

224
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:40,940
Talking is not
your dad's best skill,

225
00:18:40,942 --> 00:18:41,912
you know that.

226
00:18:43,145 --> 00:18:44,647
<i>It was like talking about it
made it real for him.</i>

227
00:18:45,515 --> 00:18:46,814
But it was real.

228
00:18:46,816 --> 00:18:49,685
It was chemo and radiation
and pain.

229
00:18:49,986 --> 00:18:51,388
And losing her hair?

230
00:18:52,588 --> 00:18:55,291
God, Steve, the day she died,
he even looked surprised!

231
00:18:59,662 --> 00:19:02,833
Look, I married a cop.
I know the drill.

232
00:19:03,398 --> 00:19:05,665
You put on the badge
and the gun,

233
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:07,101
and you head out the door.

234
00:19:07,103 --> 00:19:09,006
Not knowing
if you're coming home.

235
00:19:09,806 --> 00:19:11,538
And you leave us behind

236
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:14,711
with a smile and little wave
and all that terror.

237
00:19:15,678 --> 00:19:18,482
And we suck it up.
We deal with it. We cope.

238
00:19:19,015 --> 00:19:21,449
But when she needed him
to do the same for her,

239
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:22,618
he failed.

240
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,356
Right till the very end,
he made her be the strong one.

241
00:19:28,857 --> 00:19:31,427
I'm not gonna be like that,
okay?

242
00:19:32,362 --> 00:19:33,960
I'm gonna be right here with you

243
00:19:33,962 --> 00:19:35,999
every step of the way,
with you and little Sarah.

244
00:19:37,366 --> 00:19:38,567
Or little Suzie.

245
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,471
Georgina?

246
00:19:46,008 --> 00:19:48,612
I love you both.
You're my whole life.

247
00:19:53,482 --> 00:19:54,984
You're gonna be a great dad.

248
00:20:03,459 --> 00:20:05,461
- That's your father.
- Of course it is.

249
00:20:29,484 --> 00:20:31,487
Hey,
what's happening, Mike?

250
00:20:32,087 --> 00:20:35,024
Well, you know, same old shit.

251
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:26,410
Hey, listen, you're not gonna
believe what I just found out.

252
00:21:27,676 --> 00:21:28,677
Is everything all right?

253
00:21:30,546 --> 00:21:31,948
Lisa's pregnant.

254
00:21:32,615 --> 00:21:33,747
- Wow!
- Yeah.

255
00:21:33,749 --> 00:21:35,152
Wow!

256
00:21:36,551 --> 00:21:38,554
- Wow. Well, that's, that's...
- Yeah.

257
00:21:39,555 --> 00:21:40,856
- some news.
- Mm.

258
00:21:41,557 --> 00:21:42,826
Oh, yeah.

259
00:21:46,828 --> 00:21:47,829
I'm happy for you guys.

260
00:21:50,967 --> 00:21:53,903
Thanks, Mike. Thank you. That...
that means a lot.

261
00:21:56,972 --> 00:21:59,576
Hey, you should give her a call.

262
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:03,046
Just one call.
She'd love to hear from you.

263
00:22:09,251 --> 00:22:10,854
So how do we look?

264
00:22:11,653 --> 00:22:13,888
I have 1.36 million.

265
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:16,590
Perfect like always.
Thank you, Judith.

266
00:22:16,592 --> 00:22:18,028
Thanks, Randall.

267
00:22:20,596 --> 00:22:23,296
Look, we open in two,
so let's keep up the good work.

268
00:22:23,298 --> 00:22:25,132
If you start to get low,
call me over

269
00:22:25,134 --> 00:22:27,200
before you run out of cash,
not after.

270
00:22:27,202 --> 00:22:29,138
- Got it, Randall.
- Let's have a great day.

271
00:23:30,967 --> 00:23:33,803
- How many 223 rounds total?
- Fifty-two hundred.

272
00:23:34,604 --> 00:23:35,672
It's good.

273
00:23:36,838 --> 00:23:39,073
More likely we won't need
to use it. Get it packed up.

274
00:23:39,075 --> 00:23:41,244
- Yeah.
- Here you go.

275
00:23:43,078 --> 00:23:45,548
Yeah, sitting here,
enjoying my coffee.

276
00:23:47,883 --> 00:23:49,085
Yeah.

277
00:23:49,818 --> 00:23:51,086
Yeah.

278
00:24:18,913 --> 00:24:21,151
- Here you go.
- Ah, hold on.

279
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:25,989
Why don't you
keep the change, darling?

280
00:24:27,022 --> 00:24:28,991
- Thank you.
- Have a nice day.

281
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,260
Yeah, you, too.

282
00:24:35,897 --> 00:24:38,899
Driveway up here.
Parks the car. Main entrance.

283
00:24:38,901 --> 00:24:40,604
All windows face the street.

284
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:42,402
Opposition?

285
00:24:42,404 --> 00:24:44,337
One security guard.
Inconsequential.

286
00:24:44,339 --> 00:24:47,009
- How about hostages?
- Half a dozen staff.

287
00:24:47,676 --> 00:24:49,144
Number of customers variable.

288
00:24:49,345 --> 00:24:51,944
Fire exit's in the same room
as the main doors.

289
00:24:51,946 --> 00:24:54,280
- No back way out.
- Five minutes.

290
00:24:54,282 --> 00:24:56,719
We handle that, we're gone
and we're rich.

291
00:24:57,153 --> 00:24:59,154
- Hurrah.
- Hurrah.

292
00:25:03,358 --> 00:25:05,025
<i>This is the time
to retire.</i>

293
00:25:05,027 --> 00:25:07,161
<i>I'm... I'm retiring
at the right time.</i>

294
00:25:07,163 --> 00:25:08,964
- I was a cop at the right time.
- That's right.

295
00:25:09,164 --> 00:25:11,800
You're gonna have a lot of crap
to deal with moving forward.

296
00:25:12,034 --> 00:25:13,169
- I know.
- A lot of crap.

297
00:25:14,303 --> 00:25:15,369
Because everyone's got a camera,
everyone's got a lawyer,

298
00:25:15,371 --> 00:25:18,675
and it's just... it's not...
it's not a good time.

299
00:25:25,448 --> 00:25:27,182
Sign here, please.

300
00:25:27,916 --> 00:25:29,850
So when should I be back
to pick him up?

301
00:25:29,852 --> 00:25:33,189
- They should be back around six.
- And this is completely safe?

302
00:25:34,089 --> 00:25:35,991
Yes, we do these ride-alongs
all the time.

303
00:25:36,357 --> 00:25:38,357
I'll make sure the officer
has your number and uh,

304
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:40,195
he'll give you a call
when they're on their way back.

305
00:25:40,996 --> 00:25:42,462
Okay, thanks.

306
00:25:42,464 --> 00:25:44,967
- All right. Love you, mom.
- I love you, too.

307
00:25:58,079 --> 00:25:59,947
Hey, Mack? I didn't know it was

308
00:25:59,949 --> 00:26:01,817
Bring Your Grandpa
to Work Day.

309
00:26:02,484 --> 00:26:04,418
I would've brought
mine too, man.

310
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,487
Oh, yeah? How you gonna bring
yours? He get paroled?

311
00:26:06,489 --> 00:26:07,955
Actually, it looks like

312
00:26:07,957 --> 00:26:09,957
I'm gonna be a grandfather,
after all.

313
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:11,991
Can't pull out what you
can't put in, buddy.

314
00:26:11,993 --> 00:26:14,961
Yeah, Mack finally got
my fucking daughter pregnant.

315
00:26:14,963 --> 00:26:16,963
Oh, well, I guess
it could've been worse.

316
00:26:16,965 --> 00:26:17,797
It could've been you.

317
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:19,266
Why you gotta say that, man?

318
00:26:19,268 --> 00:26:21,501
- 'Cause I'm black?
- No. Yes.

319
00:26:21,503 --> 00:26:22,905
All right.

320
00:26:23,138 --> 00:26:25,074
No, seriously, guys.
Congratulations.

321
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,046
So I hear Chandler's thinking
about retiring.

322
00:26:34,048 --> 00:26:35,248
Never happen.

323
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:37,886
- You think?
- Cops like him don't retire.

324
00:26:38,887 --> 00:26:41,156
- What about cops like me?
- You?

325
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:44,257
You'll be cleaning your gun
one day and shoot your foot off.

326
00:26:44,259 --> 00:26:46,259
- Hilarious.
- Maybe your nuts.

327
00:26:46,261 --> 00:26:47,730
Hey, let me ask you something.

328
00:26:48,897 --> 00:26:50,898
You ever think about going
into comedy?

329
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,466
You'd be amazing
with a microphone.

330
00:26:52,468 --> 00:26:54,000
I thought about it.

331
00:26:54,002 --> 00:26:56,271
But seriously,
you're a shitty shooter.

332
00:26:56,872 --> 00:26:58,538
It all depends
what I'm shooting at.

333
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,306
- Oh.
- Thanks for the pep talk.

334
00:27:00,308 --> 00:27:01,478
Anytime.

335
00:27:02,877 --> 00:27:05,411
- Good morning, MacAvoy.
- Yeah, it is.

336
00:27:05,413 --> 00:27:07,282
- How's the new guy?
- New.

337
00:27:10,152 --> 00:27:11,254
"Ride-along?"

338
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,322
What kind of shit is this?

339
00:27:21,163 --> 00:27:23,098
Can't believe
we've gotta do this.

340
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,303
We all have to be
Officer Bill some days.

341
00:27:28,037 --> 00:27:31,341
You ready to go?

342
00:27:33,375 --> 00:27:37,180
- Um, yeah, I guess.
- You guess? Stand up.

343
00:27:39,582 --> 00:27:41,081
I hope you don't think
that this is some kind of

344
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:42,481
fun adventure you can run home
and brag about

345
00:27:42,483 --> 00:27:44,317
to your friends,
'cause it's not, little man.

346
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:45,585
You are here
'cause you fucked up,

347
00:27:45,587 --> 00:27:46,855
you understand?

348
00:27:48,057 --> 00:27:50,326
- Yeah, I understand.
- Something funny?

349
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,160
No. I'm sorry.

350
00:27:53,162 --> 00:27:55,130
Then you better wipe
that goofy smirk off your face.

351
00:27:59,201 --> 00:28:01,403
All right.
Walk over to the front door.

352
00:28:01,936 --> 00:28:03,372
Stop when you get to it.

353
00:28:17,619 --> 00:28:19,254
<i>23-Paul-01,</i>

354
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,719
<i>we have a 4-88 report.</i>

355
00:28:20,721 --> 00:28:24,961
<i>21560 Abraham Street.
White male, mid-30's.</i>

356
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,964
23-Paul-1, copy. In route.

357
00:28:33,635 --> 00:28:35,838
It's time. Load up.

358
00:29:02,131 --> 00:29:03,563
<i>23-Paul-1.
We're 97 and out</i>

359
00:29:03,565 --> 00:29:05,532
with a possible petty
theft subject.

360
00:29:05,534 --> 00:29:07,337
<i>Copy that, 23-Paul-1.</i>

361
00:29:08,537 --> 00:29:11,540
Hey, stay where you are.
Stand up!

362
00:29:12,674 --> 00:29:14,277
Put your hands in the air.

363
00:29:16,144 --> 00:29:17,480
<i>Let me see your hands.</i>

364
00:29:19,682 --> 00:29:21,617
I said put your hands up!

365
00:29:22,084 --> 00:29:23,717
- Do it now!
- What did I do, man?

366
00:29:23,719 --> 00:29:25,052
That's what we're gonna
find out.

367
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:27,624
- <i>Just do what he tells you.</i>
- Hands behind the head!

368
00:29:28,289 --> 00:29:30,457
Interlace the fingers!
Spread your legs.

369
00:29:30,459 --> 00:29:32,025
I don't understand.
I didn't do anything wrong.

370
00:29:32,027 --> 00:29:33,296
Spread your fucking legs.

371
00:29:33,729 --> 00:29:35,161
You got anything sharp
in those pockets?

372
00:29:35,163 --> 00:29:36,963
- Any needles gonna poke me, huh?
- No, man.

373
00:29:36,965 --> 00:29:38,164
- You sure about that?
- Yeah.

374
00:29:38,166 --> 00:29:39,301
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

375
00:29:41,436 --> 00:29:42,568
I'm gonna get
the clerk's statement.

376
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:43,402
Copy that.

377
00:29:43,404 --> 00:29:45,074
- So can I go, man?
- No.

378
00:29:51,246 --> 00:29:53,212
That guy always comes
around here,

379
00:29:53,214 --> 00:29:55,250
begging for money
and stuff, right?

380
00:29:55,718 --> 00:29:58,354
The guy walks out
with a carton of cigarettes.

381
00:30:07,462 --> 00:30:09,062
Okay, we're a couple
of blocks out.

382
00:30:09,064 --> 00:30:10,133
Let's go through it.

383
00:30:10,465 --> 00:30:11,667
I park us out front,

384
00:30:12,201 --> 00:30:13,600
keep my eyes open
for any heroes.

385
00:30:13,602 --> 00:30:16,103
I'm first through the door
and over the barrier.

386
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:18,270
I'm in second with the bags.

387
00:30:18,272 --> 00:30:20,640
I'm third through the door.
I handle crowd control.

388
00:30:20,642 --> 00:30:22,241
Take the safe key,
open the safe.

389
00:30:22,243 --> 00:30:23,642
Luke, you load the bags.

390
00:30:23,644 --> 00:30:25,746
- I take the first bag.
- I take the second bag.

391
00:30:25,748 --> 00:30:27,413
Everyone back in the vehicle.

392
00:30:27,415 --> 00:30:29,482
That's when we drive away
slo-mo, brothers.

393
00:30:29,484 --> 00:30:32,087
In and out.
Five minutes max, guys.

394
00:30:32,621 --> 00:30:34,621
- Am I being arrested?
- Not yet.

395
00:30:34,623 --> 00:30:36,225
I'll tell you if you are.

396
00:30:39,361 --> 00:30:40,630
Is this your bag?

397
00:30:42,096 --> 00:30:44,500
- Is it or isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

398
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,132
You mind if I search it?

399
00:30:46,134 --> 00:30:47,436
- Do I have a choice?
- No.

400
00:30:59,781 --> 00:31:02,114
23-Paul-1, we have one
in custody.

401
00:31:02,116 --> 00:31:03,517
Can you roll us
a transport unit?

402
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:04,988
I have a rider and no cage.

403
00:33:12,647 --> 00:33:14,416
- Come on!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

404
00:33:15,416 --> 00:33:16,651
Come on!

405
00:33:17,251 --> 00:33:18,453
Come on!

406
00:33:19,587 --> 00:33:21,688
- Everybody, get down!
- Get the fuck down!

407
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:24,524
Calm down! Calm down!

408
00:33:24,526 --> 00:33:25,894
- Get down!
- Calm down! Calm down!

409
00:33:26,394 --> 00:33:27,794
Get the fuck down!

410
00:33:27,796 --> 00:33:30,830
Don't move! Don't...
don't fucking move!

411
00:33:30,832 --> 00:33:31,898
Any fucking heroes,

412
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,136
I'll take your fucking heads
off!

413
00:33:34,369 --> 00:33:35,201
Open the fucking door before
I shoot your fucking head off!

414
00:33:35,203 --> 00:33:36,336
Oh, yeah.

415
00:33:36,338 --> 00:33:39,439
Well done, well done,
well done, well done, well done.

416
00:33:39,441 --> 00:33:41,744
Everybody out right now!
You, too! Out!

417
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,283
Open the fucking vault.

418
00:33:50,853 --> 00:33:52,822
Open the fucking safe.
Open it! Come on!

419
00:33:54,489 --> 00:33:55,557
Come on!

420
00:34:01,496 --> 00:34:02,832
All right.
Get the fuck out of the way.

421
00:34:04,365 --> 00:34:05,864
You got one minute
to pack up the cash.

422
00:34:05,866 --> 00:34:07,234
You know me, bro.
I got this.

423
00:34:07,236 --> 00:34:08,738
- Get it done! Come on!
- I will!

424
00:34:14,342 --> 00:34:15,441
Okay, listen up,
everybody!

425
00:34:15,443 --> 00:34:18,311
I want to see everyone's phone
on the ground, now!

426
00:34:18,313 --> 00:34:20,347
Get it done!
Put all the phones in this!

427
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:21,581
Come on!

428
00:34:21,583 --> 00:34:23,219
Out, out, out with your phones!

429
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:27,856
Go, go, go! Do it now!
Go, go, go, go, go.

430
00:34:28,923 --> 00:34:30,789
Everybody! You, too!

431
00:34:30,791 --> 00:34:34,197
Get the phone out,
now! Come on, faster! Go!

432
00:34:46,007 --> 00:34:47,909
I'll be right back.

433
00:34:57,018 --> 00:34:58,353
Hey, brothers...

434
00:34:59,454 --> 00:35:01,920
why don't you, uh, keep it cool
in there for a minute.

435
00:35:01,922 --> 00:35:04,759
<i>Looks like we got some
County blues making a donut run.</i>

436
00:35:09,764 --> 00:35:13,235
- Rob! What's going on?
- Local police are here.

437
00:35:15,903 --> 00:35:17,670
<i>Hands behind the head!</i>

438
00:35:17,672 --> 00:35:18,907
<i>Interlace the fingers!</i>

439
00:35:20,074 --> 00:35:20,675
- <i>Spread your legs.</i>
- <i>I don't understand.</i>

440
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:23,846
- <i>I didn't do anything wrong.</i>
- Will you shut that thing off?

441
00:35:25,914 --> 00:35:28,648
My mom tells me to keep in on,
just in case of an emergency.

442
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:31,653
I'm here in case
of an emergency. Give it to me.

443
00:35:32,521 --> 00:35:34,523
- You can't just take my phone.
- I'm not taking it.

444
00:35:37,793 --> 00:35:39,092
Everywhere I go these days,

445
00:35:39,094 --> 00:35:41,931
I've got a goddamn camera
in my face.

446
00:35:42,664 --> 00:35:44,567
You can have it back
when I drop you off.

447
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,398
You're just mad 'cause
you can't go around

448
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,703
- beating up anybody anymore.
- Yeah.

449
00:35:48,936 --> 00:35:50,272
You're one to talk.

450
00:35:51,407 --> 00:35:53,342
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Means I read your file.

451
00:35:53,708 --> 00:35:54,609
Battery?

452
00:35:55,476 --> 00:35:57,779
- Yeah.
- That's a pretty serious charge.

453
00:35:58,813 --> 00:36:01,449
I mean, I guess
I did hurt someone, but...

454
00:36:02,818 --> 00:36:04,020
it's a long story.

455
00:36:09,724 --> 00:36:11,427
You don't look like a tough guy.

456
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,796
What is it?
What, you just like to fight?

457
00:36:15,429 --> 00:36:17,565
No... not at all.

458
00:36:19,367 --> 00:36:20,568
I just get bullied.

459
00:36:22,103 --> 00:36:24,472
Get choked out, punched, kicked,

460
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,042
pushed against a wall.

461
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,745
It just keeps getting worse.

462
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:32,448
But you hurt another kid. Why?

463
00:36:33,648 --> 00:36:36,052
I mean, he pushed me
into the toilet, so...

464
00:36:37,018 --> 00:36:38,487
I just closed my eyes and swung.

465
00:36:42,791 --> 00:36:44,593
Yeah, I would've done
the same thing.

466
00:36:46,994 --> 00:36:49,331
Why do you think these assholes
are bullying you?

467
00:36:50,998 --> 00:36:52,367
I don't know.

468
00:36:53,467 --> 00:36:54,736
Guess 'cause I'm different.

469
00:36:55,737 --> 00:36:57,340
They want me to change, but...

470
00:36:58,539 --> 00:36:59,742
I can't.

471
00:37:00,876 --> 00:37:02,345
What about your friends?

472
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:04,413
Don't you have anybody
who'll stick up for you?

473
00:37:06,547 --> 00:37:07,949
I don't have any friends.

474
00:37:10,552 --> 00:37:12,488
Well, no one's gonna pick
on you today.

475
00:37:13,487 --> 00:37:14,954
I'll make sure of it.

476
00:37:14,956 --> 00:37:16,392
Sounds good.

477
00:37:18,927 --> 00:37:20,363
Here you go.

478
00:37:29,637 --> 00:37:31,037
- Hey, Mack.
- Hmm?

479
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:32,842
Look at that Escalade
in front of the bank.

480
00:37:34,842 --> 00:37:36,111
It's parked in the red.

481
00:37:50,125 --> 00:37:52,394
We have a couple
of overachievers here.

482
00:38:00,534 --> 00:38:03,536
23-Paul-1, we're gonna be out
with a black Cadillac Escalade.

483
00:38:07,842 --> 00:38:10,879
Let's give them something else
to worry about. Hyde.

484
00:38:12,112 --> 00:38:13,548
<i>Make the call.</i>

485
00:38:14,548 --> 00:38:16,117
- Enjoy, gentlemen.
- Thank you.

486
00:38:18,753 --> 00:38:20,890
- I'm gonna go for a smoke.
- Okay.

487
00:38:30,965 --> 00:38:32,434
Let's do this.

488
00:38:48,849 --> 00:38:50,118
Do you see the plate?

489
00:38:53,054 --> 00:38:54,590
Almost.

490
00:38:56,257 --> 00:38:57,724
<i>All units, explosion</i>

491
00:38:57,726 --> 00:38:59,992
<i>at 10-33 Cranberry Boulevard.</i>

492
00:38:59,994 --> 00:39:03,028
<i>Possible terrorist activity.
All units respond.</i>

493
00:39:12,206 --> 00:39:13,509
Fuck!

494
00:39:13,974 --> 00:39:15,074
Do we go?

495
00:39:15,076 --> 00:39:16,478
Not with the kid
riding along.

496
00:39:17,012 --> 00:39:19,014
We'll stay on
Mr. Parking Violation.

497
00:39:24,152 --> 00:39:26,755
- They're not going for it.
- Give them a minute.

498
00:39:28,289 --> 00:39:29,958
Hyde, stay frosty.

499
00:39:36,565 --> 00:39:38,767
You're gonna help my friend
bag up the cash.

500
00:39:45,806 --> 00:39:47,642
- Jacobs!
- Take it.

501
00:39:47,976 --> 00:39:49,943
I'm a shitty marksman,
remember?

502
00:39:49,945 --> 00:39:52,912
- Just don't shoot me in the ass.
- Copy that.

503
00:39:52,914 --> 00:39:54,646
I want a four-block perimeter,

504
00:39:54,648 --> 00:39:56,918
FOP the lot behind
Willard Automotive.

505
00:39:57,117 --> 00:39:59,822
Keep sharp for
secondary bombers. Let's go!

506
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:12,932
<i>Gangway, let emergency personnel</i>

507
00:40:12,934 --> 00:40:14,637
<i>get in there and do their job.</i>

508
00:40:15,003 --> 00:40:16,071
<i>Once again,</i>

509
00:40:17,338 --> 00:40:18,503
<i>a terrible explosion.
Now, we have confirmation...</i>

510
00:40:18,505 --> 00:40:21,609
Okay, listen up. We need
to clear the ER for incoming.

511
00:40:21,809 --> 00:40:23,275
The snifflers, stomach aches,

512
00:40:23,277 --> 00:40:24,943
broken bones get sent
to County.

513
00:40:24,945 --> 00:40:26,949
I need all triage teams
standing by.

514
00:40:27,248 --> 00:40:29,081
- Dr. Metcalf.
- On it.

515
00:40:29,083 --> 00:40:30,885
All elective surgeries
will be cancelled.

516
00:40:31,152 --> 00:40:34,387
Linda, alert burn unit.
Anybody not prepping

517
00:40:34,389 --> 00:40:36,889
is donating blood.
Let's move, people! Now!

518
00:40:36,891 --> 00:40:39,628
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

519
00:40:40,829 --> 00:40:42,362
<i>...now,
still being dispersed...</i>

520
00:40:48,836 --> 00:40:50,105
<i>...uh, it can't be confirmed...</i>

521
00:40:54,708 --> 00:40:55,777
<i>Breaking news. We have</i>

522
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:58,211
<i>just received information,
a devastating explosion</i>

523
00:40:58,213 --> 00:41:00,746
<i>has just rocked the city
of Chesterford.</i>

524
00:41:00,748 --> 00:41:02,782
<i>Eight people
are reportedly dead,</i>

525
00:41:02,784 --> 00:41:04,052
<i>with scores more injured.</i>

526
00:41:05,521 --> 00:41:06,889
<i>Although reports of casualties
are now just still coming in,</i>

527
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:10,188
<i>the death toll is expected
to rise. We will, of course...</i>

528
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:13,194
GPS. New destination.
Chesterford.

529
00:41:13,661 --> 00:41:17,265
<i>Recalculating route.
Exit 16.</i>

530
00:41:17,666 --> 00:41:19,934
<i>Turn right at Deeter Avenue.</i>

531
00:41:47,161 --> 00:41:49,030
All right, gentlemen,
let's keep it secure.

532
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:51,296
I want snipers on all roofs.
Go.

533
00:41:51,298 --> 00:41:54,068
And get me intel on who, what,
when and why this happened.

534
00:41:54,768 --> 00:41:56,037
Captain Horst!

535
00:41:57,838 --> 00:41:59,771
The waitress was outside
having a smoke.

536
00:41:59,773 --> 00:42:02,708
She says no one walked in.
The explosion came from inside.

537
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:03,911
Does anyone else confirm that?

538
00:42:22,864 --> 00:42:25,800
Kenny, get down!

539
00:42:26,333 --> 00:42:27,935
Back up! Back up! Go, go, go!

540
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:30,972
Kenny, stay down on the floor!

541
00:42:34,208 --> 00:42:36,108
Shots fired! Shots fired!
Code 9!

542
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:38,244
<i>We have officers in need
of assistance! Shots fired!</i>

543
00:42:38,246 --> 00:42:39,948
- That's MacAvoy.
- Go.

544
00:42:40,248 --> 00:42:41,983
We'll finish our sweep
and catch up.

545
00:42:43,251 --> 00:42:46,284
Yo, what the fuck, Tre?
The hell's going on out there?

546
00:42:46,286 --> 00:42:49,956
Stay with the plan, Luke!
Rob, what's going on?

547
00:42:49,958 --> 00:42:51,226
Hyde's lighting them up.

548
00:42:52,092 --> 00:42:54,028
Oh, my God!

549
00:43:13,014 --> 00:43:15,380
Get on the ground!
Put your heads down!

550
00:43:15,382 --> 00:43:17,752
We're not here
to play any games!

551
00:43:23,458 --> 00:43:26,394
Kenny! Stay down on the floor
and cover your head!

552
00:43:32,132 --> 00:43:34,268
Fuck! Chandler! Fuck.

553
00:43:41,141 --> 00:43:43,010
Chandler! My seat belt's stuck!

554
00:43:48,882 --> 00:43:50,416
One suspect
with an automatic weapon

555
00:43:50,418 --> 00:43:51,818
outside National Bank!

556
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:53,756
It's a possible 2-11
in progress!

557
00:44:00,094 --> 00:44:01,329
What should we do?

558
00:44:02,329 --> 00:44:04,032
Get everyone in the office.

559
00:44:04,898 --> 00:44:06,034
Hey.

560
00:44:07,135 --> 00:44:08,300
You're gonna show my partner
where your office is.

561
00:44:08,302 --> 00:44:12,106
You already have the money.
Why don't you just leave?

562
00:44:12,974 --> 00:44:14,943
None of these people have done
anything to you.

563
00:44:15,309 --> 00:44:16,344
I said,

564
00:44:17,445 --> 00:44:19,781
you're gonna show my partner
where your office is.

565
00:44:21,048 --> 00:44:23,818
He can't breathe!
Let him go!

566
00:44:27,188 --> 00:44:29,858
You. Get up. Get up, bitch!
Get up!

567
00:44:31,226 --> 00:44:34,329
You feel like talking?
Shut the fuck up! Shut the...

568
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:58,353
Stay down, okay!
Just stay down!

569
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:06,961
Dammit, the shooter's
coming this way!

570
00:45:27,148 --> 00:45:29,585
- Stay down, Kenny!
- What are you going to do now?

571
00:45:37,257 --> 00:45:39,994
- Guys, don't leave me here!
- No one's leaving you!

572
00:45:45,532 --> 00:45:47,266
Chandler, there's another
shooter in the doorway!

573
00:45:47,268 --> 00:45:49,605
- He's got a hostage!
- I can't see it from here!

574
00:45:56,043 --> 00:45:59,679
Now, y'all gonna sit down,
face the wall, Indian style.

575
00:45:59,681 --> 00:46:01,148
Sit down, fat man!

576
00:46:01,548 --> 00:46:03,951
Come on now, let's go!
Make it quick!

577
00:46:06,353 --> 00:46:07,622
Get in there!

578
00:46:08,289 --> 00:46:09,291
Let's go.

579
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:27,373
<i>Help! Help! Get me
out of here, please! Help!</i>

580
00:46:27,375 --> 00:46:31,077
Mack! Back door's jammed!
Get Kenny out of the car!

581
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:32,080
Help!

582
00:46:40,755 --> 00:46:43,125
Come on! Come on!

583
00:46:44,358 --> 00:46:46,124
Stay down! Stay down! You hurt?

584
00:46:46,126 --> 00:46:47,596
- No, I'm good.
- Okay.

585
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:52,063
- Mack, you got Kenny?
- Yeah, he's right here!

586
00:46:52,065 --> 00:46:53,733
Can you come around
to this side?

587
00:46:53,735 --> 00:46:56,369
Yeah, I think so.
We're coming now! Listen to me.

588
00:46:56,371 --> 00:46:58,204
You keep your head down
and get down!

589
00:46:58,206 --> 00:46:59,374
You run
as fast as you can, okay?

590
00:47:02,677 --> 00:47:04,211
Go, go, go, go!

591
00:47:07,347 --> 00:47:08,616
Ah!

592
00:47:34,175 --> 00:47:35,377
No, ah!

593
00:48:01,268 --> 00:48:03,269
Ah, fuck! I got shot!

594
00:48:03,271 --> 00:48:04,706
- Where?
- I got shot!

595
00:48:15,148 --> 00:48:17,085
Ah! Fuck!

596
00:48:17,351 --> 00:48:20,021
Fuck!

597
00:48:24,092 --> 00:48:25,494
He fucking shot me!

598
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:29,297
23-Paul-1,
I have an officer down.

599
00:48:29,563 --> 00:48:31,764
- Repeat, officer down.
- I'm hit, Mike!

600
00:48:31,766 --> 00:48:33,331
- I'm fucking hit, man!
- Just hang on, man!

601
00:48:33,333 --> 00:48:35,166
- I'm hit!
- I'm just trying to get the...

602
00:48:35,168 --> 00:48:36,771
get the med kit! Hang on!

603
00:48:51,485 --> 00:48:54,188
Stay with me, Mack.
It's only a scratch.

604
00:48:56,324 --> 00:48:58,657
I'm bleeding out, Mike.
Mike, I'm bleeding out.

605
00:48:58,659 --> 00:49:00,659
- List... I'm gonna die today.
- No, listen!

606
00:49:00,661 --> 00:49:02,193
You just listen to me!

607
00:49:02,195 --> 00:49:05,366
You hold on!
You are not dying today!

608
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:08,335
All right? Kenny, come here.

609
00:49:08,603 --> 00:49:10,401
I need you to keep pressure
on that wound.

610
00:49:10,403 --> 00:49:12,606
Just twist it. Just like that.
Just twist it really tight.

611
00:49:13,907 --> 00:49:15,610
Ah, yeah.

612
00:49:19,746 --> 00:49:21,750
You're doing great.

613
00:49:28,356 --> 00:49:30,759
- Everybody get down!
- Come on, come on, come on!

614
00:49:31,791 --> 00:49:33,291
- Hey.
- Hmm?

615
00:49:33,293 --> 00:49:34,626
Forget about that for now.

616
00:49:34,628 --> 00:49:36,394
They're gonna set
a perimeter on us soon.

617
00:49:36,396 --> 00:49:38,365
- We're going out the front?
- I don't think so.

618
00:49:38,766 --> 00:49:41,266
Time to change the plan.
Grab the Zytec.

619
00:49:41,268 --> 00:49:42,503
Ah, it's party time.

620
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:55,583
Here. Right here.

621
00:50:00,922 --> 00:50:02,389
We're gonna take care of you,
ma'am.

622
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:04,559
Suzie, get orthopedic
down here.

623
00:50:04,958 --> 00:50:06,527
- I'm on it.
- Shawnie.

624
00:50:06,793 --> 00:50:08,394
- Yes.
- Get ready for more incoming.

625
00:50:08,396 --> 00:50:09,662
Oh, my God. Not another bomb.

626
00:50:09,664 --> 00:50:11,666
No, bank robbery,
multiple gunshot victims.

627
00:50:11,965 --> 00:50:13,400
What?

628
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:23,976
Yeah, I got four snipers
on the roofs.

629
00:50:23,978 --> 00:50:26,615
- Perimeter's secure.
- Okay. Copy that 10-4.

630
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:28,617
Captain Horst?

631
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:30,818
Rossi, Interpol.

632
00:50:31,284 --> 00:50:33,318
This is really not
a good time, Ms. Rossi.

633
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:34,820
I'm kind of busy right now,
okay?

634
00:50:34,822 --> 00:50:36,458
I believe we can assist
each other.

635
00:50:36,757 --> 00:50:38,557
- Really?
- I found this,

636
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:40,458
in a warehouse
outside of town

637
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:43,831
- as part of my investigation.
- C-4. Where'd you get this?

638
00:50:45,365 --> 00:50:46,601
Here's the address.

639
00:50:48,436 --> 00:50:50,001
Okay, now you got
my attention.

640
00:50:50,003 --> 00:50:51,970
Just don't go wandering off
anywhere, okay?

641
00:50:51,972 --> 00:50:53,375
May I look around?

642
00:50:54,641 --> 00:50:57,443
Sure. Just please do me
a favor and don't...

643
00:50:57,445 --> 00:50:59,010
- Do not touch anything.
- Yeah.

644
00:50:59,012 --> 00:51:00,715
And you know what,
you can start with,

645
00:51:01,315 --> 00:51:03,449
the waitress. She's over there
by the ambulance.

646
00:51:03,451 --> 00:51:04,786
I think she might be helpful.

647
00:51:05,885 --> 00:51:07,322
Thank you.

648
00:51:24,505 --> 00:51:25,673
Thank you.

649
00:51:27,007 --> 00:51:28,809
Have you seen
any of these men?

650
00:51:38,485 --> 00:51:42,389
Him. He was here this morning.
He left a really big tip.

651
00:51:44,824 --> 00:51:46,227
Thank you.

652
00:52:00,974 --> 00:52:02,677
That's right, Kenny. Real tight.

653
00:52:04,644 --> 00:52:05,646
Mike...

654
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:07,646
I'm stone-cold, man.

655
00:52:07,648 --> 00:52:09,782
I can feel I'm going
into hypovolemic shock.

656
00:52:09,784 --> 00:52:12,686
- I can feel it.
- Mack. Mack!

657
00:52:13,586 --> 00:52:15,320
Medical, I need someone
out here now!

658
00:52:15,322 --> 00:52:17,655
I'm cold, man. I can feel it.
I'm going cold.

659
00:52:17,657 --> 00:52:19,657
If you fucking die on me,
I'll fucking kill you!

660
00:52:19,659 --> 00:52:22,427
Kenny, twist it tight!
Press down hard!

661
00:52:22,429 --> 00:52:23,931
- You got this?
- Yeah.

662
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:34,409
Going hot.

663
00:52:36,344 --> 00:52:37,545
Sending!

664
00:52:48,088 --> 00:52:49,690
We're almost out of this,
Mack.

665
00:52:53,094 --> 00:52:56,431
Kenny, stay sharp.
You're doing great.

666
00:52:58,099 --> 00:52:59,965
Delaney, we gotta
press forward, man!

667
00:52:59,967 --> 00:53:01,336
We can't stay here!

668
00:53:08,141 --> 00:53:09,710
You're gonna be okay.

669
00:53:14,114 --> 00:53:15,482
Bull's-eye!

670
00:53:23,791 --> 00:53:27,461
MacAvoy. MacAvoy!
MacAvoy!

671
00:53:27,862 --> 00:53:29,927
I'm not doing good, Kenny.
I'm not doing good.

672
00:53:29,929 --> 00:53:31,532
No, you cannot die!

673
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,869
Wake up! Stay with me!

674
00:53:36,137 --> 00:53:38,472
You can't go. You can't go!

675
00:53:38,806 --> 00:53:41,342
You can't go.

676
00:54:01,628 --> 00:54:02,764
Sniper!

677
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:05,666
Office down! Officer down!

678
00:54:24,784 --> 00:54:27,654
<i>...emergency
personnel are now on the scene.</i>

679
00:54:29,456 --> 00:54:31,425
Wake up! Wake up!

680
00:54:32,059 --> 00:54:33,795
What do you want me to do?
I don't know how to help.

681
00:54:34,061 --> 00:54:35,663
MacAvoy, wake up!

682
00:54:36,163 --> 00:54:37,532
Stay with me!

683
00:54:41,135 --> 00:54:42,570
I wish you...

684
00:54:43,536 --> 00:54:45,072
to record me on your phone.

685
00:54:47,106 --> 00:54:48,942
- Right now?
- Yeah.

686
00:54:49,809 --> 00:54:51,813
And I want you to make
a video of me...

687
00:54:52,746 --> 00:54:54,014
on your phone, right now.

688
00:54:55,148 --> 00:54:57,684
- A video...
- Yeah, just do it, Ken.

689
00:54:59,085 --> 00:55:00,421
Just do it.

690
00:55:01,889 --> 00:55:03,024
It's recording.

691
00:55:07,561 --> 00:55:08,630
Honey.

692
00:55:11,264 --> 00:55:12,800
Something bad happened and...

693
00:55:13,833 --> 00:55:16,003
<i>I know I promise you
every morning that</i>

694
00:55:16,269 --> 00:55:17,605
I'll be safe and...

695
00:55:18,672 --> 00:55:20,974
I'll make it back to you,
back home safely, but...

696
00:55:21,509 --> 00:55:23,577
<i>I can't keep that promise
today.</i>

697
00:55:26,914 --> 00:55:29,050
I really didn't think
I'd go out like this.

698
00:55:31,985 --> 00:55:33,587
<i>I just wanna say...</i>

699
00:55:35,989 --> 00:55:37,157
<i>that I love you.</i>

700
00:55:44,731 --> 00:55:46,134
And I love our baby.

701
00:55:49,869 --> 00:55:51,072
Hey, kiddo...

702
00:55:52,072 --> 00:55:53,208
I'm your dad.

703
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:55,877
<i>I'm sorry I'm such a mess
right now...</i>

704
00:55:57,077 --> 00:55:59,079
<i>and I'm sorry I'm not there
for you. It's...</i>

705
00:56:00,146 --> 00:56:01,548
<i>it's not fair.</i>

706
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:04,485
<i>And life's tough, so...</i>

707
00:56:05,286 --> 00:56:07,151
<i>you have to be twice as strong
for your dad, okay?</i>

708
00:56:07,153 --> 00:56:08,655
'Cause I can't protect you.

709
00:56:09,155 --> 00:56:10,891
But I will always be your dad.

710
00:56:12,626 --> 00:56:15,763
Turn it off.

711
00:56:21,902 --> 00:56:24,972
Come here!
Listen to me. Listen.

712
00:56:56,336 --> 00:56:58,539
<i>Hey, this is Steve.
I'm not here right now.</i>

713
00:57:02,208 --> 00:57:04,278
Pick up, baby,
come on, come on.

714
00:57:06,246 --> 00:57:07,845
<i>Hey, this is Steve.
I'm not here right now.</i>

715
00:57:07,847 --> 00:57:09,250
<i>So leave a...</i>

716
00:57:17,690 --> 00:57:20,224
Hanson, I gotta get to 23!
I gotta get to Chandler!

717
00:57:20,226 --> 00:57:21,693
I'm gonna keep firing!

718
00:57:21,695 --> 00:57:23,362
Where's medical?
This is bullshit!

719
00:57:23,364 --> 00:57:24,963
- I can hear them coming!
- Stay low.

720
00:57:24,965 --> 00:57:26,768
- Where's he hit?
- In the chest!

721
00:57:27,266 --> 00:57:29,101
- It went through his vest?
- Yes, straight through.

722
00:57:29,103 --> 00:57:30,901
- You gotta cover me!
- Cover! 10-4!

723
00:57:30,903 --> 00:57:33,639
- At three, I'm gonna move!
- Move, move, move!

724
00:57:33,641 --> 00:57:35,643
- Move! Move!
- Move, move, move! Let's go!

725
00:57:39,246 --> 00:57:40,882
Come on, take cover!

726
00:57:52,393 --> 00:57:55,262
- Ah, shit!
- He's... he's gone!

727
00:57:56,262 --> 00:57:57,598
He's gone!

728
00:57:58,297 --> 00:58:00,398
Come on, he's gone!
Let's get out of here!

729
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,868
Let's go! Move!

730
00:58:13,079 --> 00:58:16,180
Mack, my man. You're gonna
be fine, Mack, okay? All right?

731
00:58:16,182 --> 00:58:17,818
- Hanson, Hanson...
- You're gonna be fine.

732
00:58:21,889 --> 00:58:24,626
- I need another mag!
- I'm on my last one!

733
00:58:24,925 --> 00:58:28,693
We're moving!
On three, two, one! Get up!

734
00:58:28,695 --> 00:58:31,162
Go! Let's go! Come on!

735
00:58:31,164 --> 00:58:33,166
Jacobs, we're moving!
Lay down cover fire!

736
00:58:33,434 --> 00:58:36,037
- I got him.
- Let's go! Go, go!

737
00:58:37,036 --> 00:58:38,839
- Come on, keep going!
- Come on!

738
00:59:04,197 --> 00:59:05,932
Move, move, move, move!

739
00:59:26,353 --> 00:59:28,356
- Move! Let's go!
- Move, move, move!

740
00:59:29,856 --> 00:59:32,360
Snap! Come on!
We're gonna lay him right here.

741
00:59:33,092 --> 00:59:35,696
Be careful with him.
He's hit in the leg.

742
00:59:39,032 --> 00:59:40,831
No sign of vitals.
Give me four units of O-neg.

743
00:59:40,833 --> 00:59:42,833
- We gotta move him now.
- Hell, I'm going to get Jacobs.

744
00:59:42,835 --> 00:59:43,971
All right, I'll be back!

745
00:59:46,273 --> 00:59:48,041
I got you! I got you!

746
00:59:51,010 --> 00:59:53,411
Come on! Come on!
Just hang in there!

747
00:59:53,413 --> 00:59:55,382
Those motherfuckers!

748
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:15,099
Until SWAT gets here,

749
01:00:15,101 --> 01:00:17,871
we're gonna lock this area down
so no one else dies today.

750
01:00:18,539 --> 01:00:20,539
- You with me?
- Yeah, I'm good.

751
01:00:20,541 --> 01:00:22,143
- Where's Kenny?
- Who?

752
01:00:22,909 --> 01:00:25,010
The kid! My ride-along.

753
01:00:25,012 --> 01:00:26,211
He was with Jacobs.
Where is he?

754
01:00:26,213 --> 01:00:27,412
- We gotta find him.
- All right, all right.

755
01:00:27,414 --> 01:00:29,947
You guys go find the kid.
I'm gonna lock this place down.

756
01:00:29,949 --> 01:00:32,018
- All right. Copy.
- Come on, let's move.

757
01:00:33,586 --> 01:00:36,423
We're gonna have to wait
for dark. Move back!

758
01:00:39,159 --> 01:00:41,329
You guys have a...
have a teenager?

759
01:00:41,894 --> 01:00:43,427
A teenager? I don't think so.

760
01:00:55,576 --> 01:00:57,911
- Hello?
- <i>Dad?</i>

761
01:01:02,449 --> 01:01:03,851
Lisa...

762
01:01:05,052 --> 01:01:07,355
<i>They're taking him
to St. Luke's. Honey, I...</i>

763
01:01:08,121 --> 01:01:09,490
It doesn't look good.

764
01:01:12,592 --> 01:01:14,361
I'm sorry.

765
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:52,898
Gunshot wound to the leg.

766
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:54,535
We already shocked him twice
on the way.

767
01:01:55,501 --> 01:01:58,172
Trauma one. Right here.

768
01:02:03,911 --> 01:02:06,414
Excuse me? Scalpel.

769
01:02:32,438 --> 01:02:34,407
- Ma'am, you can't...
- That's my husband.

770
01:02:35,375 --> 01:02:36,340
- Steve!
- Ma'am, you gotta leave.

771
01:02:36,342 --> 01:02:38,478
I'm not going anywhere!
This is my husband!

772
01:02:38,711 --> 01:02:40,447
- Let us do our job! Ma'am!
- I'm here, baby.

773
01:02:41,014 --> 01:02:42,149
I'm here.

774
01:02:42,682 --> 01:02:44,018
We're both here.

775
01:02:55,329 --> 01:02:58,298
Gunshot. Looks like
a clear exit wound.

776
01:03:00,634 --> 01:03:04,105
- Jacobs? Jacobs, what happened?
- Not now.

777
01:03:05,605 --> 01:03:08,108
Mike and Steve stumbled
on a bank job.

778
01:03:08,608 --> 01:03:11,512
Those motherfuckers
have more firepower than the...

779
01:03:12,378 --> 01:03:14,447
- than the devil.
- Doc,

780
01:03:14,981 --> 01:03:16,583
the dressing was plugging
the wound.

781
01:03:17,050 --> 01:03:18,483
I gotta see it to fix it.

782
01:03:18,485 --> 01:03:20,354
Jacobs, is my dad
still at the scene?

783
01:03:21,054 --> 01:03:22,590
Probably looking for the kid.

784
01:03:23,623 --> 01:03:24,625
What kid?

785
01:03:26,492 --> 01:03:27,628
Ride-along.

786
01:03:28,195 --> 01:03:30,128
Mike and Steve had a ride-along.

787
01:03:30,130 --> 01:03:32,233
That's my baby. That's Kenny.

788
01:04:00,226 --> 01:04:02,329
That's him! That's his ring!
That's his ring!

789
01:04:02,561 --> 01:04:03,998
Here.

790
01:04:08,235 --> 01:04:09,503
Yes, baby, it's...

791
01:04:09,802 --> 01:04:12,405
it's me. I'm here. I'm here,
Kenny. Where are you?

792
01:04:12,639 --> 01:04:15,376
I'm in this parking lot.
I'm in this car by the bank.

793
01:04:16,108 --> 01:04:17,508
They're robbing the bank.
They're shooting people.

794
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:20,311
I know, honey. I know.
Are... are you safe?

795
01:04:20,313 --> 01:04:22,516
I don't know. I think
I should be good where I am.

796
01:04:22,715 --> 01:04:24,652
Okay. Listen, listen.

797
01:04:25,251 --> 01:04:26,586
Don't move, okay?

798
01:04:26,786 --> 01:04:29,119
Don't move until the police
or somebody safe

799
01:04:29,121 --> 01:04:31,458
- comes to get you, okay?
- Mom, I'm scared.

800
01:04:32,391 --> 01:04:33,391
I know, baby.

801
01:04:33,393 --> 01:04:35,463
I know, but we're gonna
get through this, okay?

802
01:04:35,661 --> 01:04:37,564
You and me,
we're gonna get through this.

803
01:04:37,797 --> 01:04:40,432
You're gonna be tough.
I'm gonna be tough.

804
01:04:40,434 --> 01:04:42,266
And you're my tough guy, okay?

805
01:04:42,268 --> 01:04:45,070
Mom, my phone is gonna go off.

806
01:04:45,072 --> 01:04:48,273
Okay. You stay there, hear me?

807
01:04:48,275 --> 01:04:50,809
Don't move.
Stay right where you are.

808
01:04:50,811 --> 01:04:53,311
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

809
01:04:53,313 --> 01:04:55,016
Mom?

810
01:04:55,681 --> 01:04:56,750
Mom?

811
01:05:03,289 --> 01:05:04,759
Hello? He's...

812
01:05:05,358 --> 01:05:06,494
he's gone.

813
01:05:07,226 --> 01:05:08,495
My boy.

814
01:05:47,867 --> 01:05:49,469
<i>Gentlemen,
what's the status?</i>

815
01:05:50,369 --> 01:05:53,371
Lieutenant, my partner,
Officer MacAvoy and I,

816
01:05:53,373 --> 01:05:54,809
were first on the scene.

817
01:05:55,509 --> 01:05:57,876
We pulled up at approximately
ten hundred hours,

818
01:05:57,878 --> 01:06:00,345
and immediately witnessed
a black Escalade

819
01:06:00,347 --> 01:06:02,115
running curbside about 50 yards

820
01:06:02,615 --> 01:06:04,117
from the entrance to the bank.

821
01:06:04,818 --> 01:06:07,822
There was a white male
seated behind the wheel.

822
01:06:08,355 --> 01:06:10,487
Did you notice
any of the suspects entering

823
01:06:10,489 --> 01:06:12,490
- or exiting the bank?
- No, sir.

824
01:06:12,492 --> 01:06:14,925
At the moment, we were focused
on the vehicle and the driver,

825
01:06:14,927 --> 01:06:17,362
but just as we came to a stop,

826
01:06:17,364 --> 01:06:19,229
the driver stepped out
of the Escalade

827
01:06:19,231 --> 01:06:21,367
with a fully automatic
assault rifle...

828
01:06:22,434 --> 01:06:23,770
and that is when...

829
01:06:25,672 --> 01:06:27,307
we... we began...

830
01:06:28,375 --> 01:06:30,510
taking incoming fire and my...

831
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:36,684
partner was hit.

832
01:06:37,817 --> 01:06:39,516
No other passengers
in your vehicle?

833
01:06:39,518 --> 01:06:42,689
Uh, yes, sir. Yes, we had
one ride-along in... in the back.

834
01:06:42,922 --> 01:06:44,524
You had a ride-along
in the back?

835
01:06:45,391 --> 01:06:46,659
Well, where's
the ride-along now?

836
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:47,892
Where's the ride-along now?

837
01:06:47,894 --> 01:06:50,597
I don't know where
the ride-along is, sir.

838
01:06:51,931 --> 01:06:53,666
What took you so long?

839
01:06:55,668 --> 01:06:56,934
Chandler, I just need to know
if there was...

840
01:06:56,936 --> 01:06:58,302
I need to know
where the ride-along is.

841
01:06:58,304 --> 01:06:59,739
What... no, what...
what took you so long?

842
01:07:00,206 --> 01:07:01,838
We... we can only get
to this active shooter

843
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:04,342
- as quick as possible...
- No, you were an hour late,

844
01:07:04,344 --> 01:07:05,943
- and we were outgunned.
- Chandler...

845
01:07:05,945 --> 01:07:09,282
And my... and my son is dead!

846
01:07:09,815 --> 01:07:11,217
He's dead!

847
01:07:11,418 --> 01:07:14,588
He has a child on the way!

848
01:07:15,288 --> 01:07:16,690
What took you so long?

849
01:07:21,427 --> 01:07:23,860
Chandler, you gotta de-escalate.

850
01:07:23,862 --> 01:07:26,296
You gotta let me put together
my SWAT team here,

851
01:07:26,298 --> 01:07:27,731
let me get an entry plan
in place,

852
01:07:27,733 --> 01:07:28,865
so we can get into this building

853
01:07:28,867 --> 01:07:30,467
and get this structure cleared.

854
01:07:30,469 --> 01:07:32,305
I need you to bring it
down for me, okay?

855
01:07:38,612 --> 01:07:41,282
- Who the hell are you?
- Rossi, Interpol.

856
01:07:41,614 --> 01:07:42,847
Okay and?

857
01:07:42,849 --> 01:07:44,617
She gave us the lead
on the warehouse.

858
01:07:44,884 --> 01:07:45,816
And?

859
01:07:45,818 --> 01:07:47,719
And she confirmed
who we're dealing with.

860
01:07:47,721 --> 01:07:49,454
Okay, I'm well aware
of who we're dealing with.

861
01:07:49,456 --> 01:07:51,192
I'm very familiar
with these assholes.

862
01:07:51,724 --> 01:07:54,358
Well, that's very American
of you to say.

863
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:55,994
Okay, listen, listen, listen.
I got the Mayor...

864
01:07:55,996 --> 01:07:58,329
excuse me... I got the Mayor
crawling up my ass, okay?

865
01:07:58,331 --> 01:07:59,731
I got the Governor talking
about flying out here

866
01:07:59,733 --> 01:08:00,932
to coordinate this thing.
Right now,

867
01:08:00,934 --> 01:08:01,999
I don't have time for this.

868
01:08:02,001 --> 01:08:03,635
I either need these guys
in cuffs,

869
01:08:03,637 --> 01:08:05,206
or I need these guys in a slab.

870
01:08:05,472 --> 01:08:06,938
And Agent,
whatever your name is,

871
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:08,773
if you've got useful intel
that I can use

872
01:08:08,775 --> 01:08:11,476
for my entry team, then go ahead
and coordinate it, okay?

873
01:08:11,478 --> 01:08:12,278
I'm done.

874
01:08:12,646 --> 01:08:14,878
Your Lieutenant
is an imbecile.

875
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,481
Hey, you know what,
I'm pretty sure

876
01:08:16,483 --> 01:08:18,485
Mike Chandler would agree
with you on that one.

877
01:08:18,917 --> 01:08:20,817
Officer Chandler learned
what those men

878
01:08:20,819 --> 01:08:22,555
in the bank are capable of.

879
01:08:23,657 --> 01:08:25,626
Thank you,
we already have a plan.

880
01:08:26,826 --> 01:08:29,395
These men don't go
by the book, Captain.

881
01:08:29,628 --> 01:08:31,497
They're waiting for you
to attack.

882
01:08:32,532 --> 01:08:33,567
Have you read Moltke?

883
01:08:35,902 --> 01:08:39,303
"No plan of operations
extends with any certainty."

884
01:08:39,305 --> 01:08:42,375
"Beyond the first contact
with the main hostile force."

885
01:08:42,574 --> 01:08:43,978
Is that the best you can do?

886
01:08:44,577 --> 01:08:47,648
These men are experts
at the point of first contact.

887
01:08:47,913 --> 01:08:49,849
They turn plans
against the planner.

888
01:08:50,050 --> 01:08:52,253
An escape route becomes a trap.

889
01:08:52,786 --> 01:08:54,989
Tell me, what do I do?
Do I let them go?

890
01:08:55,654 --> 01:08:58,259
- Wait it out? Hmm?
- I just...

891
01:08:58,658 --> 01:09:00,090
No, wait, te... tell me,
what the hell

892
01:09:00,092 --> 01:09:02,528
do I do when they start
shooting hostages in there?

893
01:09:03,329 --> 01:09:04,664
- I just...
- Just what?

894
01:09:09,435 --> 01:09:11,005
I want you to understand.

895
01:09:11,805 --> 01:09:15,275
They will use your assault
to leverage their escape.

896
01:09:16,009 --> 01:09:17,810
Everyone on that street
will be in danger.

897
01:09:37,363 --> 01:09:38,963
This reminds me of that
extraction we did in Kabul.

898
01:09:38,965 --> 01:09:40,734
- Remember that shit?
- Mm-hmm.

899
01:09:43,770 --> 01:09:47,608
- How many killings did you get?
- Thirty-two.

900
01:09:48,574 --> 01:09:50,310
That's right. The legend.

901
01:09:56,716 --> 01:09:58,715
We made it out of there,
we can make it out of here.

902
01:09:58,717 --> 01:10:00,320
Not much longer now.

903
01:10:00,886 --> 01:10:02,989
We're gonna walk outta here
with over a mill.

904
01:10:03,722 --> 01:10:05,022
Well, that's a lot more
than we ever made

905
01:10:05,024 --> 01:10:06,660
from the military, isn't it?

906
01:10:07,527 --> 01:10:08,729
We're not home yet.

907
01:10:09,929 --> 01:10:12,333
We can expect SWAT very soon.

908
01:10:12,498 --> 01:10:13,733
Let's do what we do.

909
01:10:14,868 --> 01:10:16,737
I'm gonna go check up
on the hostages.

910
01:10:16,935 --> 01:10:18,404
Right.

911
01:10:32,752 --> 01:10:35,756
- Everybody good to go?
- 10-4.

912
01:10:47,766 --> 01:10:49,470
No, no. No, man!

913
01:10:49,935 --> 01:10:51,436
I wasn't...
I wasn't doing anything!

914
01:10:51,438 --> 01:10:52,571
What the fuck do you think
you're doing?

915
01:10:52,573 --> 01:10:54,575
- I wasn't doing nothing, man.
- You leave him alone!

916
01:10:56,042 --> 01:10:57,644
You're not a hero.

917
01:10:59,546 --> 01:11:02,082
You're gonna shoot me? Come on,
just go ahead and do it.

918
01:11:02,782 --> 01:11:05,386
Shoot me right here now.
Yes, yes, yes.

919
01:11:22,836 --> 01:11:24,438
Eat something.

920
01:11:31,543 --> 01:11:32,712
Any intel?

921
01:11:32,945 --> 01:11:34,611
We were able to access
the bank's interior

922
01:11:34,613 --> 01:11:35,612
surveillance cameras.

923
01:11:35,614 --> 01:11:38,952
We have hostages.
My best count makes it 13.

924
01:11:41,087 --> 01:11:42,954
Red team,
we can make our approach

925
01:11:42,956 --> 01:11:45,726
from the east corner here,
slow and deliberate.

926
01:11:45,958 --> 01:11:47,825
Blue team, opposite side.

927
01:11:47,827 --> 01:11:49,861
Force entry here, right through
the main entrance.

928
01:11:49,863 --> 01:11:52,633
Now, from the video, it looks
like we have four suspects.

929
01:11:52,832 --> 01:11:54,034
We'll assume there's more.

930
01:11:54,567 --> 01:11:56,170
- Any questions?
- Negative.

931
01:11:57,103 --> 01:11:59,472
I can get five guns in there
in three seconds.

932
01:12:00,773 --> 01:12:02,643
- Set it up.
- You got it.

933
01:12:03,576 --> 01:12:04,578
All right, gentlemen,

934
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:06,145
let's keep the casualties down
to a minimum, okay?

935
01:12:06,813 --> 01:12:08,579
Roger that.

936
01:12:08,581 --> 01:12:09,716
Sir.

937
01:12:10,649 --> 01:12:11,915
Chandler, what's up?

938
01:12:11,917 --> 01:12:13,050
Sir, what about the kid?

939
01:12:13,052 --> 01:12:15,221
He's gotta be out there
in that parking lot somewhere.

940
01:12:15,854 --> 01:12:18,591
We got this. Just let us
do our job, okay?

941
01:12:18,858 --> 01:12:21,128
Sir, he's my responsibility.

942
01:12:21,661 --> 01:12:22,762
Not anymore.

943
01:12:25,631 --> 01:12:28,167
We'll get the ride-along.
Let's move out!

944
01:13:17,115 --> 01:13:18,585
Here they come.

945
01:13:20,587 --> 01:13:21,822
I'll go get Tre.

946
01:13:44,077 --> 01:13:45,244
Go.

947
01:13:51,384 --> 01:13:54,253
Nice having y'all.
Just line it up here.

948
01:13:54,686 --> 01:13:56,086
It's the beginning
of the end right now.

949
01:13:56,088 --> 01:13:58,824
Come on, move it in.
Let's go! Let's go!

950
01:13:58,992 --> 01:14:00,761
- Come on.
- Get the fuck out.

951
01:14:02,228 --> 01:14:03,564
Moving.

952
01:14:12,704 --> 01:14:14,307
Be advised SWAT's moving in.

953
01:14:23,382 --> 01:14:26,150
Now come on, move it in!
Let's go! Let's go!

954
01:14:26,152 --> 01:14:28,385
Go! Faster, faster!
Don't fuck up.

955
01:14:28,387 --> 01:14:29,989
One, two. One, two.

956
01:14:30,789 --> 01:14:31,858
Right.

957
01:14:32,725 --> 01:14:34,728
Single line. Single line.

958
01:14:37,063 --> 01:14:39,932
It's him.
He's in that Chevy Blazer.

959
01:14:40,265 --> 01:14:41,768
I'm going for him.

960
01:14:42,301 --> 01:14:43,937
SWAT's about to make entry.

961
01:14:44,203 --> 01:14:46,173
I don't care. I can't leave him.

962
01:14:46,405 --> 01:14:49,141
If you wanna go get the kid,
I'm with you. Okay?

963
01:14:49,876 --> 01:14:53,614
- Let's go get the kid.
- This is my deal. I can't ask.

964
01:14:54,012 --> 01:14:55,148
Look, you didn't ask.

965
01:14:55,814 --> 01:14:57,149
And we're brothers.

966
01:14:57,783 --> 01:15:00,286
Yeah, we are.
Let's go get him.

967
01:15:00,886 --> 01:15:02,322
All right,
let's do this.

968
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:15,369
Stop him!

969
01:15:23,842 --> 01:15:26,179
Listen to me. Listen!
You're almost there.

970
01:15:26,445 --> 01:15:28,379
When I say go, get them
through the door

971
01:15:28,381 --> 01:15:31,251
and into the parking lot.
Okay? Okay?

972
01:15:32,385 --> 01:15:34,721
Rob, Luke! Let's set up!

973
01:15:52,404 --> 01:15:54,006
We're gonna have
to make a run for it.

974
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:57,110
- Okay. Follow me.
- I'll cover you.

975
01:15:57,877 --> 01:15:59,079
All right, I'm moving.

976
01:16:04,216 --> 01:16:05,818
- Kenny!
- Chandler!

977
01:16:08,988 --> 01:16:10,955
Come on. SWAT's gonna breach
the building.

978
01:16:10,957 --> 01:16:12,292
Gotta get to safe distance.

979
01:16:20,533 --> 01:16:23,270
Nice and easy, boys.
Nice and easy.

980
01:16:36,015 --> 01:16:38,051
Okay, guys, 10 seconds.

981
01:16:40,386 --> 01:16:42,255
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

982
01:16:46,993 --> 01:16:48,395
Move, move, move!

983
01:16:51,530 --> 01:16:54,134
- Move! Move!
- He put something in my pocket!

984
01:16:54,533 --> 01:16:56,135
- Where?
- Here!

985
01:17:02,007 --> 01:17:04,344
Shit! Move!

986
01:17:05,043 --> 01:17:06,313
Shit!

987
01:17:13,886 --> 01:17:15,789
Go, go, go!

988
01:17:18,291 --> 01:17:19,760
Grenades!

989
01:17:34,940 --> 01:17:38,377
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Goddammit! Fuck!

990
01:17:39,478 --> 01:17:41,512
Get them the fuck
out of there now!

991
01:17:41,514 --> 01:17:44,083
All of them,
I want them out! Now!

992
01:17:59,599 --> 01:18:01,802
Let's take these assholes out!

993
01:18:20,619 --> 01:18:22,154
Point right!

994
01:18:49,582 --> 01:18:50,984
Push him back!

995
01:18:57,390 --> 01:18:59,426
Hanson, keep firing!

996
01:19:08,434 --> 01:19:10,203
Ah, fuck!

997
01:19:33,725 --> 01:19:35,161
You all right?

998
01:20:11,229 --> 01:20:13,666
Kenny? Kenny!

999
01:20:18,237 --> 01:20:20,640
Oh! Are you all right?

1000
01:20:21,207 --> 01:20:22,642
- I'm fine.
- You sure?

1001
01:20:23,208 --> 01:20:24,944
One hundred percent.

1002
01:20:31,250 --> 01:20:32,519
You did good today.

1003
01:20:33,351 --> 01:20:34,487
Thank you.

1004
01:20:36,087 --> 01:20:37,623
Sorry it turned out like this.

1005
01:21:00,813 --> 01:21:02,248
Dad!

1006
01:21:10,288 --> 01:21:13,726
- I love you, sweetheart.
- I love you, too, dad.

1007
01:21:50,429 --> 01:21:52,095
- Surprise!
- Happy birthday!

1008
01:21:52,097 --> 01:21:53,496
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday, old man!

1009
01:21:53,498 --> 01:21:54,598
What are you guys doing here?

1010
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:56,036
- Come here! Come here!
- Happy birthday!

1011
01:21:56,301 --> 01:21:58,434
- Surprise!
- There's people in my house.

1012
01:21:58,436 --> 01:22:00,838
Can't have that.
How'd you get in?

1013
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:03,107
We got him good.

1014
01:22:12,384 --> 01:22:14,087
Come kiss your granddaughter.

1015
01:22:16,387 --> 01:22:17,720
Hey, Kenny, where's that phone

1016
01:22:17,722 --> 01:22:19,458
you're always screwing
around with?

1017
01:22:21,327 --> 01:22:23,063
I wanna take some new pics.

1018
01:22:27,587 --> 01:22:32,587
